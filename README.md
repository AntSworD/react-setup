# react-setup
**A lightweight React setup: Babel, React, React Router, React Boostrap, React-intl, Mocha, Webpack HMR, PostCSS, ESLint.**

I prefer to keep this setup lightweight but feel free to sprinkle some more pixie dust (Redux, Koa, etc.) to bake your project :)

## More Features
* I18n with [React-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl)
* Babel ES6: class syntax for React components
* Code coverage with [isparta](https://github.com/douglasduteil/isparta)
* ESLint ES6 configuration
* Debug ES6 code with webpack
* Development and Production build
